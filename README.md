## 📸 Project Screenshots

**1. Traditional Bean Creation** — Creating beans manually with new instances

**2. Configuration-Based Bean Creation** — Using `@Configuration` and `@Bean` annotations

**3. Component Scanning** — Automatic bean discovery with `@Component`

**4. @PostConstruct Lifecycle Hook** — Initialization before bean usage

**5. @PreDestroy Lifecycle Hook** — Cleanup during application shutdown
> 🔔 `@PreDestroy` is called when the application stops and wants to destroy the beans

**6. Prototype Scope** — New instance on every request

**7. Dependency Injection — @Primary** — Resolve multiple bean candidates

**8. Dependency Injection — @ConditionalOnProperty** — Conditional bean creation

**9. Field Injection** — Using `@Autowired` on fields

**10. Constructor Injection** — Dependency injection via constructor

**11. Final Fields with Constructor** — Immutable dependency pattern

**12. Bean Map Interface** — Retrieve all bean instances as Map

**13. Maven — Compile Command** — Compile source code

**14. Maven — Clean Command** — Remove build artifacts

**15. Maven — Package Command** — Build JAR/WAR

**16. Maven — Install Command** — Install to local repository

## 📥 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 17 or higher
- Maven 3.8+
- IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rahulthakare04/Spring-Boot-Basics.git
cd Spring-Boot-Basics
```

### Build the Project
```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Run the Application
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
Or run directly:
```bash
java -jar target/spring-boot-basics-1.0.0.jar
```

---

## 🎯 Usage

### Example 1: Creating Beans with @Configuration
```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    
    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyServiceImpl();
    }
}
```

### Example 2: Component Scanning
```java
@Component
public class UserService {
    
    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        System.out.println("Bean initialized!");
    }
    
    @PreDestroy
    public void cleanup() {
        System.out.println("Bean destroyed!");
    }
}
```

### Example 3: Constructor Injection (Recommended)
```java
@Service
public class OrderService {
    
    private final PaymentService paymentService;
    
    @Autowired
    public OrderService(PaymentService paymentService) {
        this.paymentService = paymentService;
    }
}
```

### Example 4: Conditional Bean Creation
```java
@Configuration
public class DatabaseConfig {
    
    @Bean
    @ConditionalOnProperty(name = "db.type", havingValue = "mysql")
    public DataSource mysqlDataSource() {
        return new MySQLDataSource();
    }
    
    @Bean
    @ConditionalOnProperty(name = "db.type", havingValue = "postgres")
    public DataSource postgresDataSource() {
        return new PostgreSQLDataSource();
    }
}
```
